# Task 1: Identify anomalies in the dataset

# Look at the preceding table. How close is the predicted value to the label value? In other words, does your model accurately predict house values?

# predict_house_values(10, my_feature, my_label)

# ANSWER: It's very swingy. It doesn't accurately predict house values at all compared to the actual number, and more rooms doesn't always mean more value.

#Task 3: Try a different feature
#The total_rooms feature had only a little predictive power. Would a different feature have greater predictive power? Try using population as the feature instead of total_rooms.
# Trying population now:

my_feature = "median_income"   # Replace the ? with population or possibly a different column name.
# ANSWER: population is extremely off as well. if I were to use one feature, median_income seems to be more accurate.
