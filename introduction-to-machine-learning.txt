These are my notes for Google's Introduction to Machine Learning course.

==WHAT IS MACHINE LEARNING?==
- training a piece of software (model) to make predictions from data
- the model =  mathematical relationship between the elements of data that an ML system uses to make predictions

for rain:
1. give ML model lots of weather data
2. train model to understand weather patterns that produce rain
3. give model current data => it predicts rain amount

Three Types of ML Systems:
- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning
- Reinforcement learning

SUPERVISED:
- model sees lots of data with correct answers => discovers connections that make correct answers (like studying old tests for taking a new one)
=> USE CASES:
Regression: predict numeric value
Classification: likelihood of something belonging to category (is this email spam? Is this photo a cat?)

UNSUPERVISED:
Data with no correct answers: model has to find patterns
- one technique is clustering where it pairs data that seem to match in certain ways

REINFORCEMENT:
Uses predictions to get the most rewards based on a policy and to avoid penalties
- used to train tasks like play Go

==SUPERVISED LEARNING==
Core Concepts:
- Data
- Model
- Training
- Evaluating
- Inference

DATA
Datasets have features and a label in each example like a spreadsheet row
Model uses features to predict the label (the answer)

Datasets have size (number of examples) and diversity (range the examples cover)
- You typically want large, highly diverse datasets for accurate predictions
- More features are also nice but =/= most accurate predictions

MODEL
complex collection of numbers that define the mathematical relationship from specific input feature patterns to specific output label values

TRAINING
- this is how a model finds patterns
1. model predicts a value
2. model compares prediction to actual value
3. model notes difference and modifies solution
4. repeats for each example to learn relationships

Large/diverse datasets are best for this
- You can also select which features the model uses during training to test how it makes predictions

EVALUATING
Compare the predicted values of the model with the actual values to see how it learned, and do more training/eval passes as needed

INFERENCE
Once results are good, use the model to infer predictions on unlabelled examples
